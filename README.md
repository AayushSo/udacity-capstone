# Trends and Estimations of US Energy generation and prices

##Overview
The quest for sustainable energy sources has never been more critical. However, the transitions towards a greener energy utilization landscape brings forth its own set of challenges, and understanding energy generation and consumption patterns becomes paramount. 
In this project, I shall look into the production and utilization of energy across the United States to uncover insights and identify trends. I also implement a basic ML pipeline to estimate costs of energy for different sectors based on energy and demoraphic statistics for the different states.
The project deals with the following parts:
>	1. **Data Gathering and data cleaning** : Gathering, preliminary processing and condesnsing of various datasets
>	2. **Data Exploratory Analysis** : A deeper look into our data to understand informatino provided and uncover intersting questions to ask
>	3. **Machine Learning Pipeline** : Creating a Regression pipeline to process and estimate electricity costs.
>	4. **Creating Web App** :  Creating a basic web app to highlight our learnings
